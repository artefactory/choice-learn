abstract = {Discrete choice models (DCMs) require a priori knowledge of the utility functions, especially how tastes vary across individuals. Utility misspecification may lead to biased estimates, inaccurate interpretations and limited predictability. In this paper, we utilize a neural network to learn taste representation. Our formulation consists of two modules: a neural network (TasteNet) that learns taste parameters (e.g., time coefficient) as flexible functions of individual characteristics; and a multinomial logit (MNL) model with utility functions defined with expert knowledge. Taste parameters learned by the neural network are fed into the choice model and link the two modules. Our approach extends the L-MNL model (Sifringer et al., 2020) by allowing the neural network to learn the interactions between individual characteristics and alternative attributes. Moreover, we formalize and strengthen the interpretability condition — requiring realistic estimates of behavior indicators (e.g., value-of-time, elasticity) at the disaggregated level, which is crucial for a model to be suitable for scenario analysis and policy decisions. Through a unique network architecture and parameter transformation, we incorporate prior knowledge and guide the neural network to output realistic behavior indicators at the disaggregated level. We show that TasteNet-MNL reaches the ground-truth model’s predictability and recovers the nonlinear taste functions on synthetic data. Its estimated value-of-time and choice elasticities at the individual level are close to the ground truth. In contrast, exemplary logit models with misspecified systematic utility lead to biased parameter estimates and lower prediction accuracy. On a publicly available Swissmetro dataset, TasteNet-MNL outperforms benchmarking MNLs and Mixed Logit model’s predictability. It learns a broader spectrum of taste variations within the population and suggests a higher average value-of-time. Our source code is available for research and application.}

 ISSN = {07416261},
 abstract = {We present an empirical model of households' choices among local telephone service options (for example, between flat-rate and measured service) and the interrelation of these choices with the number and average duration of local calls households make at each time of day to each geographical zone. Using a nested logit model with estimation performed on a randomly selected subset of the households' calling patterns, we calculate elasticities of demand for each local service option, number of calls, average duration, and revenues with respect to the fixed monthly charges and the usage charges for calling under each option. We find moderate price elasticities of number of calls with respect to usage charges for households subscribing to measured service. Nevertheless, raising usage charges has a negligible effect on revenues, since a sufficient number of households either originally subscribe to flat-rate service or convert to flat-rate service in response to higher usage charges. We find a high elasticity of demand for each service option with respect to its fixed monthly fee. This indicates high substitutability among service options. The shift among service options induces new calling patterns, which we find to be a small but not negligible indirect effect.},
