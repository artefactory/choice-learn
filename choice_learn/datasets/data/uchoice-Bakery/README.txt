In this universal choice dataset, subset choices are items purchased by
patrons of a Bakery. The data was derived from data at
https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/datasets/wiki/ExtendedBakery.

Each line of the two data files
1. uchoice-Bakery.txt
2. uchoice-Bakery-5-25.txt
is a space-separated list of integers, corresponding to a single subset
selection. The second file is a restriction of the subset selections in the
first file so that each selection contains at most 5 items and all items appear
in at least 25 selections. In our paper, we used the restricted (second) dataset
in our experiments.
