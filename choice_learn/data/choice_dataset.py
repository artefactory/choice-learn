    The choices are given as a ragged list of choices
    for each session. It is particularly useful if several (a lot) of choices happen
    during the same session. For example if we have the same customer buying several
    items during the same session, all its choices
    can be regrouped under the same session_features. Limits data duplication in such cases.

    The class has same methods/arguments as ChoiceDatset with a slight difference with
    self.choices being a ragged list. The returned features in self.__getitem__ are the same
    as ChoiceDataset. When calling __getitem__(index) we map index to a session index and a
    choice index within the session.
