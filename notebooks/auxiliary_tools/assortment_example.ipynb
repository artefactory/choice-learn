    "## Ending Notes\n",
    "- In this example, the outside option is automatically integrated in the AssortmentOptimizer and not computed through the model. If you compute the outside option utility and give it to AssortmentOptimizer you can set its attribute *outside_option_given* to True.\n",
    "- The current AssortmentOptimzer uses [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) for which you need a license (free for Academics) or [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization?hl=fr) that is OpenSource.\n",
    "- If you want to add custom constraints you can use the base code of the AssortmentOptimizer and manually add your constraints. Future developments will add an easy interface to integrate such needs.\n",
