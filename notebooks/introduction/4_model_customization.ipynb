    "The ChoiceModel class revolves around several methods that are shared by most models:\n",
    "- <ins>Model Specification</ins>\\\n",
    "    *.\\_\\_init\\_\\_()* and/or *.instantiate()* are used to specify the form of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "- <ins>Model Estimation</ins>\\\n",
    "    *.fit()* uses a ChoiceDataset to find the best values for the different trainable weights\n",
    "    \n",
    "- <ins>Use of the model</ins>\\\n",
    "    *.evaluate()* can be used to estimate the negative log likelihood of the model's choice probabilities compared to the ground truth from a ChoiceDataset\\\n",
    "    *.predict_probas()* can be used to predict the model's choice probabilities related to a ChoiceDataset\\\n",
    "    *.compute_batch_utility()* can be used to predict a batch items utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A few parameters are shared through the ChoiceModel class and can be changed. A full list is [available](../../choice_learn/models/base_model.py), here are the most useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **optimizer**: Name of the optimizer to use. Default is lbfgs\n",
    "    - Non-stochastic: It is recommended to use them - and in particular lbfgs - for smaller datasets and models. It is faster but needs all data in memory, therefore the batch_size argument is not used. More info on the TensorFlow [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Optimizers_in_TensorFlow_Probability).\n",
    "    - Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizers - such as Adam. They will lead to slower convergence but work well with batching. List is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers).\n",
    "- **batch_size**: Data batch size to use when stochastic gradient descent optimizer is used. Default is 32.\n",
    "- **lr:** Learning Rate of the optimizer to use when stochastic gradient descent optimizer is used. Default is 0.001.\n",
    "- **epochs:** Max number of iterations before stopping optimization. Default is 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subclassing\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used for better code formatting in Choice-Learn. It is also optimized to let anyone *easily* define its own utility model. The idea is that by subclassing ChoiceModel one only needs to define the utility function with TensorFlow for it to work.\\\n",
    "The advantages are twofold:\n",
    "- It needs little time. An example will follow to show you how it can be done in a few minutes.\n",
    "- It is possible to use non-linear formulations of the utility. As long as it is written with [TensorFlow operations](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math), Choice-Learn and TensorFlow handle the optimization. For the more adventurers, you can even [define your own operations](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/custom_gradient) as long as you provide the gradients."
